                            How well do you know JavaScript and CSS? Without using jQuery or BootStrap? Yeah. For me,
                            the answer is not good enough. This project is my attempt to work through the process of
                            creating a "modern" looking design, without bloating my header with a huge chunk of CDN
                            calls for minified files. I chose to limit myself to plain JavaScript and CSS 3. I leaned
                            heavily on some StackOverflow articles (who doesn't) and several W3Schools examples (you
                            don't?). Other than some gentle nudges in the right direction, I'm responsible for the
                            structure and (sometimes) not-so-perfectly-optimized code. I'll post my source code to
                            BitBucket or GitHub shortly. In short, this was a fun exercise.

                            I used Visual Studio Code for this project, rather than Visual Studio 2015. First, I wanted
                            to develop familiarity with the program. It's layout is a little different and definitely
                            more bare-bones than VS2015. I also wanted to make use of that simplicity for switching
                            between files, making saves, and just keeping the file structure simple as possible. If
                            you're like me, when you're navigating the unknown (and JavaScript sometimes falls into
                            that category), keeping things simple reduces your search for bugs and other dumb errors we
                            all make.

                                    Use only HTML, CSS 3, and JavaScript for any features of the application

                                    The navigation should have a collapsable menu for small screens and indicate the
                                    active section on all screens
                                </li>

                                    Navigation should smoothly take you to the desired section

                                    The navigation and header should be sticky on the top of the screen, no matter what
                                    content section is displayed

                            who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put

                            he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

                            you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly

                            reason. It's only... I just happened to look behind us and something is there. What?

                    That Vizzini, he can *fuss*. Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*. You are amazing. I
                    ought to be, after 20 years. Oh, there's something I ought to tell you. Tell me. I'm not
                    left-handed either. Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? Oh no,
                    it's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.
                    You're just stalling now. You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which
                    means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on
                    your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also
                    bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied, and in studying you must have learned that
                    man is mortal, so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly
                    not choose the wine in front of me. Grandpa, maybe you could come over and read it again to me
                    tomorrow. As you wish.

                    First things first, to the death. No. To the pain. I don't think I'm quite familiar with that
                    phrase. I'll explain and I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you warthog
                    faced buffoon. First things first, to the death. No. To the pain. I don't think I'm quite familiar
                    with that phrase. I'll explain and I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you
                    warthog faced buffoon. Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? Oh
                    no, it's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the
                    future. We'll never succeed. We may as well die here. No, no. We have already succeeded. I mean,
                    what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurt - no problem. There's a popping
                    sound preceding each; we can avoid that. Two, the lightning sand, which you were clever enough to
                    discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too. Westley, what about the
                    R.O.U.S.'s? Rodents Of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist. He's right on top of us. I wonder if
                    he is using the same wind we are using.

                    Probably he means no *harm*. He's really very short on *charm*. A book? That's right. When I was
                    your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used
                    to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today I'm gonna read it to
                    you. Finish him. Finish him, your way. Oh good, my way. Thank you Vizzini... what's my way? Pick up
                    one of those rocks, get behind a boulder, in a few minutes the man in black will come running
                    around the bend, the minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock. My way's not very
                    sportsman-like. You're trying to trick me into giving away something. It won't work. IT HAS WORKED!
                    YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING AWAY! I KNOW WHERE THE POISON IS! Then make your choice. My men are here! I
                    am here! But soon *you* will not be here!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand? Do
                    you always begin conversations this way? All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has
                    begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right... and who is dead. I
                    will, and I choose... what in the world can that be? What? Where? I don't see anything. Well, I- I
                    could have sworn I saw something. But no matter. What's so funny? Roberts had grown so rich, he
                    wanted to retire. He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret. 'I am not the Dread Pirate
                    Roberts' he said. 'My name is Ryan; I inherited the ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts,
                    just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread Pirate
                    Roberts either. His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like
                    a king in Patagonia.' Beat it or I'll call the Brute Squad. I'm on the Brute Squad. You ARE the
                    Brute Squad!

                    I challenge you to a battle of wits. For the Princess? To the death? I accept! I'll tell you in a
                    minute. First, let's drink. Me from my glass, and you from yours. You guessed wrong. You are sure
                    nobody's followed us? As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways
                    inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done, and no one in Florin could have gotten here
                    so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? No reason. It's only... I just happened to look behind
                    us and something is there. What? Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at
                    night... in... eel-infested waters... I've seen worse. Who are you? No one of consequence. I must
                    know… Get used to disappointment. kay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look, are you just fiddling around with me or what? I just want you to feel you're doing well. Who
                    are you? Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? Where is Buttercup? Let me explain. No, there is
                    too much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry Humperdinck in little less than half an hour. So all we
                    have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... after I kill
                    Count Rugen. You are amazing. I ought to be, after 20 years. Oh, there's something I ought to tell
                    you. Tell me. I'm not left-handed either. How old were you? I was eleven years old. And when I was
                    strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not
                    fail. I will go up to the six-fingered man and say, 'Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my
                    father. Prepare to die.' You are sure nobody's followed us? As I told you, it would be absolutely,
                    totally, and in all other ways inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done, and no one
                    in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? No reason. It's only...

                    All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both
                    drink, and find out who is right... and who is dead. Hello there. Slow going? Look, I don't mean to
                    be rude but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
                    Sorry. Thank you. You've done nothing but study swordplay? More pursue than study lately. You see,
                    I cannot find him... it's been twenty years now and I'm starting to lose confidence. I just work
                    for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge. Well I certainly hope you find
                    him someday. You are ready then? Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. Give us the gate
                    key. I have no gate key. Fezzik, tear his arms off. Oh, you mean *this* gate key. Doesn't sound too
                    bad. I'll try to stay awake. Oh, well, thank you very much, very nice of you. Your vote of
                    confidence is overwhelming.

                    Ah. Are you coming down into the pit? Wesley's got his strength back. I'm starting him on the
                    machine tonight. Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work, but I've got my country's
                    500th anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder and Guilder to frame for it;
                    I'm swamped. Get some rest. If you haven't got your health, then you haven't got anything. Westley
                    didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left
                    captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered… Murdered by pirates is good…
                    We'll never succeed. We may as well die here. No, no. We have already succeeded. I mean, what are
                    the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurt - no problem. There's a popping sound
                    preceding each; we can avoid that. Two, the lightning sand, which you were clever enough to
                    discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too. Westley, what about the
                    R.O.U.S.'s? Rodents Of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist. Since the invention of the kiss,
                    there have been five kisses rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all
                    behind. The end. Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. Wait till I get going! Now, where was I?
                    Australia. Yes, Australia. And you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I
                    can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
